% QUERY:I would like to know if
     'initiallyP' holds (for flow_rate(X)).

	ANSWER:	1 (in 0.12 ms)

JUSTIFICATION_TREE:
'initiallyP' holds (for flow_rate(1/10)), because
    'initiallyP' holds (for flow_rate_PerHour(6)).
The global constraints hold.

MODEL:
{ initiallyP(flow_rate(1/10)),  initiallyP(flow_rate_PerHour(6)) }
BINDINGS: 
X equal 1/10
